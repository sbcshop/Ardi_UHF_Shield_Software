### Interfacing Details

When Ardi UHF shield mounted on ArdiPi,
|ArdiPi | UHF shield | Function |
|---|---|---|
| GP1 | U_RX | Serial Tx of UHF to Serial Rx of Pico W |
| GP0 | U_TX | Serial Rx of UHF to Serial Tx of Pico W |
| GP5 | U_EN | UHF Enable pin, LOW to disable and HIGH to enable |  
| GP2 | BUZ | Buzzer +ve Pin |
| GP20/SDA | SDA | Serial Data for I2C interfacing of OLED display|
| GP21/SCL | SCL | Serial Clock for I2C interfacing of OLED display|

When Ardi UHF shield mounted on Ardi-32,
|Ardi-32 | UHF shield | Function |
|---|---|---|
| IO18 | U_RX | Serial Tx of UHF to Serial Rx of ESP32 |
| IO17 | U_TX | Serial Rx of UHF to Serial Tx of ESP32 |
